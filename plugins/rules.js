  //Tournament Rules
  'T1' : "Egregious behavior by any Team, Team member, or other representative of the Team is not tolerated at a \
FIRST Tech Challenge Tournament. Violations of this rule can result in penalties to the Team, and/or the \
issuance of a Yellow or Red Card. Egregious behavior includes, but is not limited to, repeated and/or flagrant \
violation of game rules, unsafe behavior or actions, uncivil behavior towards Volunteers, Competition \
personnel, or Event attendees.",
  
  'T2' : "Yellow Cards and Red Cards are used in the FIRST Tech Challenge to manage Team and Robot \
behavior that does not align with the mission of FIRST. Yellow and Red Cards are not limited to just the \
Competition Area. Teams that display egregious behavior in the Pit Area, Judging Rooms, stands, or any \
other location of the Event can be issued a Yellow or Red Card for egregious behavior. \
Egregious or repeated (3 or more) Robot or Team member behavior at the Event can result in a Yellow \
and/or Red Card. The Head Referee may assign a Yellow Card as a warning, or a Red Card for \
Disqualification in a match. A Yellow Card or Red Card is signaled by the Head Referee standing in front of \
the Team’s Alliance Station and holding a Yellow Card and/or Red Card in the air. \
Yellow Cards are additive, meaning that a second Yellow Card is automatically converted to a Red Card. A \
Team is issued a Red Card for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional Yellow Card, \
including earning a second Yellow Card during a single match. To issue the second yellow card, the Head \
Referee will stand in front of the Team’s Alliance Station and hold a Yellow Card and Red Card. The Head \
Referee will signal the second Yellow Card after the match has ended. \
A Team that has received either a Yellow Card or a Red Card carries a Yellow Card into following matches, \
except as noted below. A Red Card results in match Disqualification. Multiple Red Cards may lead to \
Tournament Disqualification. Once a Team receives a Yellow Card or Red Card, the Team number is \
presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning of all following matches. This \
is a reminder to the Team, referees, and audience the Team carries a Yellow Card. Yellow Cards do not carry \
over from the Qualification Matches to the Elimination Matches. During the \
Elimination Matches, Yellow and Red Cards count against the entire Alliance, not to a specific Team. If a \
Team receives a Yellow Card or Red Card, it results in the entire Alliance receiving the Yellow Card or Red \
Card for that match. If two different Teams on the same Alliance are issued Yellow Cards, the entire Alliance \
is issued a Red Card. A Red Card results in zero (0) points for that match, and the Alliance loses the match. \
If both Alliances receive Red Cards, the Alliance which committed the action earning the Red Card first \
chronologically loses the match.",
  
  'T3' : "Referees have final game play and scoring authority during the Competition. Their rulings are final. \
\na. The referees will not review any recorded match replays or photographs. \
\nb. All questions about a match or scores must be brought forward to the Referees by using the Referee \
Question Box located in the Competition Area. Only one student from an Alliance can enter the \
question box. All questions must be brought forward within the outlined time: \
\n      i. Qualification Matches: A Team must enter the question box to dispute a Match within the time \
period of three (3) matches following the disputed Match. \
\n      ii. Elimination Matches and Final Matches: A Team must enter the Referee Question Box to \
dispute a match before the start of the next match played by the Alliance, regardless if the Team \
is playing in the next match. The next match played could involve different Alliances. Questions \
about the last match of the Finals must be brought to the question box no later than 5 minutes \
after the announcement of the score of the match. \
Students must support their questions by referencing specific rules or posts to the Q&A section of the \
official FIRST Tech Challenge Forum. Team members must ask their questions in a gracious and \
respectful manner. \
\nc. Team members cannot enter the Playing Field for any reason other than to place or retrieve their \
Robots. Inspection of the Playing Field elements by Team members to determine scoring is not \
allowed. Individuals and Teams that violate this rule will be subject to possible Team penalties that \
could include match disqualifications or even removal from the Tournament.",
  
  'T4': "No Team, Team Member, or Event attendee is allowed to set up their own Wi-Fi 802.11 (2.4GHz or \
5GHz) wireless communication in the venue. Non-allowed wireless communications include, but are not limited \
to: \
\n      a. Cellular Hot spots (for example, cell phones, tablets, MiFi). \
\n      b. Ad-hoc networks. \
\n      c. Nintendo DS peer-to-peer. \
\n      d. Bluetooth communication with Robots in the Competition Area. \

prepaid meals, etc. FIRST may conduct a post-Event review and decide if any additional penalties are to be \
imposed on the offending Team. Teams are encouraged to report wireless security vulnerabilities to the Field Technical Advisor (FTA) at an \
Event. Teams should always keep in mind Gracious Professionalism® \
, and therefore only report valid and \
verifiable violations of this rule. After the Field Technical Advisor is alerted of a potential rule violation, he or \
she will confer with the Head Referee. The Field Technical Advisor and Head Referee will further explore the \
potential violation of this rule. The Head Referee will work with FIRST Headquarters staff to determine if rule \
<T4> has been violated, and to disqualify the offending Team.",
  
  'T5': "Wi-Fi Direct® connectivity between the Android devices used as the Robot Controller and the Drivers \
Station is allowed. No other wireless communication is allowed. \
The Penalty for violating rule <T5> is disqualification of the entire Team from the Event and their removal from \
the venue property. The Head Referee will work with FIRST Headquarters staff to determine if rule <T5> has \

  'T7' : "Each registered Team may enter only one Robot (a Robot built to play the current season’s game \
challenge) into the FIRST Tech Challenge Competition. It is expected that Teams will make changes to their \
Robot throughout the season and at competitions. \
\na. It is against this rule to compete with one Robot while a second is being adjusted or assembled at a \
Tournament. \
\nb. It is against this rule to switch back and forth between multiple Robots at a Tournament. \
\nc. It is against this rule to register and attend concurrent Events with a second Robot. \
\nViolations of this rule will immediately be considered egregious and a deliberate violation of the rule.",
  
  //realized you could use backticks for multi-line strings....
  
  'T8' : `Only three Team representatives are allowed in the Competition Area; two (2) student drivers, and one
(1) coach who are identified by badges labeled ‘driver’ or ‘coach.’ These badges are interchangeable within a
Team between matches. Only student Team members wearing a badge labeled as ‘driver’ may drive the Robot
during the match. Team representatives beyond the two student drivers and one coach will be asked to leave
the Competition Area immediately.`,
  
  'T9' : `Pre-Match Robot Setup – At the beginning of a match, each Alliance Robot must be set up on the Playing
Field in accordance with section 1.5.1 Pre-Match in the Game Manual Part 2. After Robots have been set up
on the Playing Field, Drive Teams are required to stand Completely Inside the Alliance Station at the location
(Station one or Station two) specified by the Qualification Match schedule.
      a. During the Qualification Matches, the Blue Alliance Robots are set up on the Playing Field first, unless
the Red Alliance waives their right to set up on the Playing Field second.
      b. During the Elimination Matches, the 3
rd and 4th seeded) Alliance Robots are set up on the Playing Field
first, unless the higher seeded Alliance waives their right to set up on the Playing Field second. Alliance
color doesn’t change the seeding of a Team during the Elimination Matches. If the 4th seed defeats the
1st seed in the Semi-Finals, they will still have to place their Robot on the field first in the Finals because
their seeding will be lower than the 2nd or 3rd seed.
      c. Teams may implicitly waive their right to place their Robots on the Playing Field last by placing their
Robots on the Playing Field before or with the opposing Alliance. There is no need to tell the referees;
Teams waive their right by the act of placing their Robots on the Playing Field.
      d. Teams that unnecessarily delay the beginning of a match and/or field reset will incur a Minor Penalty for
each offense. `,
  
  'T10' : `Scores are recorded at the end of the Autonomous Period and Driver-Controlled Period when all
objects on the Playing Field have come to rest. Scores may not be announced to the Teams until some
amount of time after the Match has completed.`,
  
  'T11' : `There are no time-outs during the Qualification Matches.`,
  
  'T12' : `If no member of the Drive Team is present in the Driver Station at the start of a match, that Team is
declared a “no show”. If a Robot cannot report for a match, at least one member of the Drive Team should
report to the Playing Field for the match.`,
  
  'T13' : `Teams will receive a minimum of five minutes (5:00) between consecutive matches.`,
  
  'T14' : `During the elimination rounds, each Alliance will be allotted ONE time-out of no more than three
minutes (3:00). Time-outs must be called at least two minutes (2:00) before their next match’s starting time.
The time-out begins at the time their match was going to start.`,
  
  'T15' : `All Team members, coaches, and their guests must wear ANSI Z87.1 certified safety glasses while in
the Pit or Competition Area. Prescription glasses with ANSI Z87.1 approved commercial off the shelf side
shields are also allowed.

NOTE: FIRST requires all Teams to bring and supply ANSI-approved safety glasses for its Team members,
mentors, and guests for each Competition. Tinted lenses are allowed as long as Event personnel can see the
Volunteer’s, spectator’s, or Team member’s eyes through the safety glasses. Sunglasses or deeply shaded
safety glasses used in our indoor Event environment are not acceptable.`,
  
  'T16' : `Skateboards, roller skates, ‘hover boards’, and drones are not allowed at any Tournament. These items
can create safety hazards to the Teams, spectators, or Volunteers attending the Event.`,
  
  'T17' : `No live bands are allowed in the audience or Pit. No loud music, audio systems, whistles, banging
sticks, blow horns, etc. are allowed. They prevent Teams from hearing important announcements. Power may
be shut off and/or noisemakers confiscated.`,
  
  'T18' : `Batteries must be charged in an open, well-ventilated area.`,
  
  'T19' : `Painting or applying harmful products, sprays, or aerosols are not allowed anywhere in the Tournament.

  'T20' : `Pit displays may not exceed 10 ft. (3.05 m) x 10 ft. (3.05 m) x 10 ft. (3.05 m) or a limit specified by the
venue, whichever is shorter.`,
  
  'T21' : `Teams are not allowed to use radios and walkie-talkies anywhere in the venue.`,
  
  'T22' : `There is no running anywhere during the Event as this is a safety hazard.`,
  
  'T23' : `Sitting together in a group during Competition matches makes the game more exciting and fun. It allows
Team members to show support for their Team. Teams are not allowed to save seating space as there is often
not enough seating to hold everyone. Repeated offenses could be considered egregious, and Teams could
face consequences for violating this rule.`,
  
  'T24' : `Soldering, gluing, brazing, or large power tools are not allowed in the Pit or Competitions Areas unless
the Event Director specifically allows them.`,
  
  'T25' : `Because of site rules or contracts, FIRST cannot allow Teams or individuals to sell items, such as Tshirts,
pins, etc., at any Events. Fundraising for a cause is allowed with consent of the Tournament Director;

outside food on-site because of contracts and agreements.`,
  
  'T27' : `Open-toed or open-backed shoes are not allowed in the Pit Area or in the Competition Area`,
  
  //General Robot Rules
  
  'RG01' : `*Illegal Parts -* The following types of mechanisms and parts are not allowed:
a. Those that could potentially damage the Playing Field and/or Scoring Elements. For example, high
traction wheels (for example, AM- 2256) and high grip tread (for example, Rough top) when used in a
Robot drive system that may damage the Playing Field are not allowed.
      For example: Black tire marks on an Element is not considered Playing
      Field damage. However, digging a hole into the Playing Field tiles can be
      considered damage.
b. Those that could potentially damage or flip other competing Robots.
c. Those that contain hazardous materials such as mercury switches, lead, or lead containing
compounds, or lithium polymer batteries (except for the Android devices’ internal battery).
d. Those that pose an unnecessary risk of entanglement.
e. Those that contain sharp edges or corners.
f. Those that contain animal-based materials (because of health and safety concerns).
g. Those that contain liquid or gel materials.
h. Those that contain materials that would cause a delay of game if released (for example, loose ball
bearings, coffee beans, etc.).
i. Those that are designed to electrically ground the Robot frame to the Playing Field.
j. Closed gas devices (for example, gas storage vessel, gas spring, compressors, etc.).
k. Hydraulic devices`,
  
  'RG02' : `*Maximum Starting Size -* The maximum size of the Robot for starting a match is 18 inches (45.72
cm) wide by 18 inches (45.72 cm) long by 18 inches (45.72 cm) high. The Robot Sizing Box will be used as the
official gauge to make sure Robots comply with this rule. To pass inspection a Robot must fit within the box
while in its match start configuration and orientation without exerting force on the sides or top of the box.
Robots may expand beyond the starting size constraint after the start of the match. The Alliance flag and preloaded
game elements may extend outside the starting volume constraint.
The Robot must be self-supporting while in the Robot Sizing Box by either:
    a. A mechanical means with the Robot in a power-OFF condition. Any restraints used to maintain starting
    size (that is, zip ties, rubber bands, string, etc.) MUST remain attached to the Robot for the entire
    match.

    b. A Robot Initialization Routine in the Autonomous operational mode (op mode) program that may preposition
    the servo motors, with the Robot in a power-ON condition, to the desired stationary position. If
    the Robot Initialization Routine does move the servos when a program is executed, there must be an
    indicator on the Robot of this fact. A warning label placed near the Robot’s main power switch is
    required. Attach the image (“WARNING! - Robot moves on Initialization”) to your Robot near the Robot
    main power switch if servos are commanded to move during the initialization routine. To be easily seen
    by field personnel the label should be at least 1 in x 2.63 in (2.54 cm x 6.68 cm, Avery Label # 5160)
    and placed on a flat surface (not wrapped around corners or cylinders).:`,
  
  'RG03' : `*Robot Controller Mount* – It is recommended the Robot Controller be accessible and visible by
competition personnel. If a Team’s Robot Controller is not accessible and/or visible to competition personnel,
the Team may not receive adequate support from the field personnel.
The Robot Controller should be mounted such the display screen is protected from contact with the Playing
Field elements and other Robots. This and other electrical parts (batteries, motor and servo controllers, 
switches, sensors, wires, etc.) make poor bumpers and are unlikely to survive the rigors of game play when
attached in a Robot-to-Robot contact area.

*Important Note:* The Robot Controller contains a built-in wireless radio that communicates with the Android
device in the Driver Station. In addition to protecting the device from impact, the Robot Controller should not be
obscured by metal or other material that could block or absorb the radio signals from the Robot Controller.
`,
  
  'RG04' : `*Alliance Flag Holder -* Robots MUST include a mounting device to securely hold one Tournament
supplied FIRST Tech Challenge Robot Alliance Identification Flag throughout an entire match. The flag MUST
be mounted at the TOP of the Robot and be clearly visible throughout the match to clearly identify a Robot’s
Alliance. Flag posts are typically a soda straw or wooden dowel. Dimensions of each are close to 0.25 inches
(0.635 cm) outer diameter x 0.20 inches (0.5 cm) inner diameter x 8.25 inches (21 cm) length with a triangular
flag 4.0 inches (10.16 cm) high x 6.0 inches (15.24 cm) wide. These may vary from Event to Event; Alliance
Flag Holders should be able to securely hold both solid core dowels and open core straws. Mounting devices
that damage the flag post are not acceptable.`,
  
  'RG05' : `*Team Number Display -* Robots MUST prominently display their Team number (numerals only, for
example “12345”) on two separate signs.
    a. The judges, referees, and announcers must be able to easily identify Robots by Team number.

    b. Team number must be visible from at least two opposite sides of the Robot (180 degrees apart).

    c. The numerals must each be at least 2.5 inches (6.35 cm high), at least in 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) stroke
width, and in a contrasting color from their background. Teams can use Arial Font, Bold, 250 point to
meet the minimum size requirements.

d. Team numbers must be robust enough to withstand the rigors of match play. Example robust materials
include: 1) self-adhesive numbers (that is, mailbox or vinyl numbers) mounted on polycarbonate sheet,
wood panel, metal plate, etc.; 2) Ink jet or laser printed numbers on paper and laminated.`,
  
  'RG06' : `*Allowed Energy Sources -* Energy used by FIRST Tech Challenge Robots, (that is, stored at the
start of a match), shall come only from the following sources:

a. Electrical energy drawn from approved batteries.

b. A change in the position of the Robot center of gravity.

c. Storage achieved by deformation of Robot parts. Teams must be careful when incorporating spring-like
mechanisms or other items to store energy on their Robot by means of part or material deformation.`,
  
  'RG07' : `*Launching Robot Parts -* Parts of the Robot itself may not be launched, even if the part launched is
still connected to the Robot by a tether (for example, wire, rope, or cable).`,
  
  'RG08' : `*Launching Game Scoring Elements –* Robots are allowed to launch game Scoring Elements
through the air unless limited by a game specific rule. It is expected that Teams will launch the elements
with just enough velocity to score. If the referees, feel that a Robot is launching Scoring Elements with
excessive velocity that would cause a safety issue if they were to leave the field, the Robot will be required to
be inspected. Robots must then demonstrate that a launched Game Element cannot travel in the air more than
a distance of 16 ft. (4.88 m) or more than 6 ft. (1.83 m) in elevation.`,
  
  //Robot Mechanical Parts and Materials Rules
  
  'RM01' : `*Allowed Materials -* Teams may use raw and post-processed materials to build their Robots,
provided they are readily available to the majority of Teams from standard distributors (for example, McMasterCarr,
Home Depot, Grainger, AndyMark, TETRIX/PITSCO, MATRIX/Modern Robotics, REV Robotics, etc.).
Examples of allowed raw materials are:
• Sheet goods
• Extruded shapes
• Metals, plastics, wood, rubber, etc.
• Magnets
Examples of allowed post-processed materials are:
• Perforated sheet and diamond plate
• Injection molded parts

• Springs of all types: compression, extension, torsion, surgical
tubing, etc.`,
  
  'RM02' : `*Commercial Off The Shelf Parts -* Teams may use Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) mechanical
parts that have a single degree of freedom. A single degree of freedom is a system whose motion is defined
just by a single independent co-ordinate (or function)1
.
It is the intent of FIRST is to encourage Teams to design their own mechanisms rather than purchasing predesigned
and pre-manufactured solutions to achieve the game challenge. Purchased mechanism kits (for
example, grippers) that violate the single degree of freedom rule, either assembled or requiring assembly, are
not allowed. COTS drive chassis (for example, AndyMark TileRunner, REV Robotics Build Kit) are allowed
provided none of the individual parts violate any other rules.
Examples of allowed single degree of freedom parts:
• Linear Slide
• Single speed (non-shifting) Gearboxes
• Pulley
• Lazy Susan
• Lead Screws
Examples of illegal multiple degrees of freedom parts:
• Gripper assemblies or kits
• Ratcheting wrenches`,

  'RM06' : `(*Allowed Assembly Methods -* Welding, brazing, soldering, and fasteners of any type are legal
methods for assembling a Robot.`,
  
  'RM07' : `*Lubricant -* Any type of COTS lubricant is allowed, if it doesn’t contaminate the Playing Field, game
elements, other Robots, etc.`,
  
  //Robot Eletrical Parts and Materials Rules
  
  'RE01' : `*Main Power Switch -* The Robot Main Power Switch must control all power provided by the Robot
main battery pack. FIRST requires Teams to use either the TETRIX (part # W39129), MATRIX (part # 50-
0030), or REV (REV-31-1387) power switch. This is the safest method for Teams and Field personnel to shut
down a Robot.
The Robot main power switch MUST be mounted or positioned to be readily accessible and visible to
competition personnel. A Main Robot Power label must be placed near the Main Power Switch of the Robot.
Attach the image (“POWER BUTTON”) to your Robot near the Main Power Switch. To be easily seen by field
personnel the label should be at least 1 in x 2.63 in (2.54 cm x 6.68 cm, Avery Label # 5160) and placed on a
flat surface (not wrapped around corners or cylinders).`,
  
  'RE02' : `*Battery Mount -* Batteries MUST be securely (for example, VELCRO, zip tie, rubber band) attached
to the Robot in a location where they will not make direct contact with other Robots or the Playing Field.`,

Autonomous period must demonstrate during Field Inspection the Driver Station switches the Robot Controller
between Autonomous mode and Driver-Controlled mode`,
  
  'RS06' : `*Robot Controller App -* The Robot Controller must have a designated “FTC Robot Controller” app
that is the default application for the Core Robot modules (Legacy, Servo, Motor, and Device Interface) or the
REV Expansion Hub.`,
  
  'RS07' : `*Driver Station App -* Teams must install the official “FTC Driver Station” app onto their Driver Station
Android Device and use this app to control their Robot during a match. The Driver Station software version

  //Inspection Rules
  
  'I1' : `>*Inspection -* Every Robot will be required to pass a full inspection before being cleared to compete. This
inspection ensures that all FIRST Tech Challenge Robot rules and regulations are met. Teams are required to
conduct a self-inspection of their Robot and submit the completed inspection forms at their designated Robot
Inspection appointment.
All Robot configurations must be inspected before being used in competition.

a. If significant changes are made to a Robot after passing initial inspection, it must be re-inspected
before it will be allowed to compete.
b. Referees or inspectors may request the re-inspection of a Robot. The Robot is not allowed to
participate in a match until it passes re-inspection. Refusal to submit to re-inspection will result in Team
disqualification from the Tournament.
c. Appendices B and C of this manual contain copies of the Robot and Field Inspection forms and provide
additional information about the inspection process.
d. A Robot may be rejected at inspection if the Lead Inspector considers it unsafe.`,
  
  'I2' : `*Practice Matches -* FIRST Tech Challenge Teams must submit their Robot for inspection before
participating in Practice Matches. At the discretion of the Lead Inspector, the Robot may be allowed to
participate in practice rounds before passing inspection.`,
  
  'I3' : `*Qualification Matches -* The Team’s Robot must pass all inspections before participating in Qualification
Matches. Noncompliance with any Robot design, construction rule, or programming requirements may result in
disqualification of the Team at a FIRST Tech Challenge Event.`,
  
  'I4' : `*Re-Inspection –* Teams that modify their Robot to improve performance or reliability are required to
request a re-inspection of their Robot by an Inspector.`,
  
  'I5' : `*Safety -* It is the Inspector’s responsibility to evaluate Robots to insure each Robot has been designed to
operate and function safely. section 8 and Game Manual Part 2, section 1.6.1 specify the safety rules and limits
that apply to the design and construction of all Robots.`,
  
  'I6' : `*Passing Inspection -* Robot inspection is a Pass/ Fail process. A Robot has passed inspection when ALL
requirements listed on the official FIRST Tech Challenge “Robot and Field Inspection Sheets” have been
successfully met and recorded as passed by an Inspector.`,
  
  'I7' : `*All Mechanisms are Inspected -* At the time of Inspection, the Robot must be presented with all
mechanisms (including all components of each mechanism), configurations, and decorations that will be used
on the Robot during the competition. It is acceptable for a Robot to play matches with a subset of the
mechanisms that were present during inspection. Only mechanisms that were present during Inspection may
be added, removed, or reconfigured between matches. The Robot should be assembled in a typical
configuration used for match play when reporting for inspection.

a. Robot and all mechanisms must be inspected in every starting configuration.
b. If mechanisms are swapped out between matches, the reconfigured Robot must still meet all Robot
rules and inspection criteria.
c. The sum of all electronics (motors, servos, Core modules, Android devices, etc.) used to construct all
mechanisms and base Robot, whether they are used on the Robot at the same time or not, may not
exceed the constraints specified in the Robot construction rules.`,
  
  'I8' : `*Wheel/Tread Playing Field Damage Test -* Robot Inspectors have the authority to request that a Team
test their wheels/treads that they feel might cause damage to the Playing Field. Since not every tread or wheel
can be evaluated and posted as a legal or illegal part, the tread test is a quick way to determine if a Team’s
wheels/treads are competition legal.
The Robot Inspector should place the Robot on top of a field tile and against an immovable surface (wall), and
run the wheels at full power for 15 seconds. If there is any physical damage to the floor tile, the wheels will not
be allowed. Discoloration or black marks alone are not considered field damage. The test must be made with
the Robot at the weight it will be at during the Competition since this will affect the degree of damage.`,
